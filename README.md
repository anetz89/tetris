# Tetris

A description is needless in this case I guess. If you do not know what Tetris is, you might try to google it (by the way - you should switch to [DuckDuckGo](www.duckduckgo.com)).

This is a html + plain JS implementation of Tetris, no use of fancy frameworks.

## Usage

To play tetris, just open the index.html page. The game starts immediately.
